  This is a tutorial project on creating a library management system with books. Books are stored in a json file. Data input and output is organized using the terminal.
  
The following functionality is currently implemented:
1. Adding a book: The user enters the title, author, and year, after which the book is added to the library with a unique id and the status “in stock”.
2. Deleting a book: The user enters the id of the book to be deleted.
3. Searching for a book: The user can search for books by title, author, or year.
4. Displaying all books: The application displays a list of all books with their id, title, author, year, and status.
5. Changing the status of a book: The user enters the id of the book and the new status (“in stock” or “issued”).
